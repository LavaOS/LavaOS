## Contributing

I'm open to contributions!

I love when the community helps in making something good, but I have to point out a few things.

Please don't make contributions that:
- Make something intentionally more obscure
- Add a huge dependency without much reasoning
- Implement or change an enormous part of the code and its structure (unless justified)
