# 🔥 LavaOS

**LavaOS** is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system, forked from [MinOS](https://github.com/Dcraftbg/MinOS).  
It aims to be minimalist, hackable, and blazing fast — powered by a custom bootstrapping compiler (`nob.c`) and a raw, low-level design.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 Forked from MinOS with key improvements
- 🧠 Built using a custom bootstrapped compiler (`nob.c`)
- 🧩 Modular, simple, and readable codebase
- 🧑‍💻 Designed for OSDev hobbyists
- 💾 Light RAM/Swap-aware build system
- 🧪 Experimental but actively maintained

---

## 🔧 Getting Started

Highly recommended distro for build: archlinux

### 💾 Clone the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LavaOS/LavaOS.git
cd LavaOS
```
### 🛠 Build the Compiler (nob)

```bash
gcc nob.c -o nob
```
### ⚙️ Build and Run the System

```bash
./nob bruh
```
## ⚠️ Heads Up

The first run will compile a full custom GCC toolchain inside your environment.
Make sure you have enough RAM + swap (recommendation: at least 4GiB RAM + 8GiB swap) to avoid out-of-memory errors.
Building may temporarily consume 1–10 GiB of space depending on your setup.
